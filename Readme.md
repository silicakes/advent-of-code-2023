# Advent of code 2023 javascript solutions

These are my solutions for the AoC challenge of 2023: https://adventofcode.com/2023/

The solutions aren't elegant but rather, a stream of thought.

It means that the time it took solving most challenges is the time it took to type in the solution.

It means that there's plenty of [clipboard inheritence](http://www.coderenaissance.com/2007/10/avoiding-clipboard-inheritance.html) present and general lack of elegance.

This was tested with nodejs v.18.16.0.
